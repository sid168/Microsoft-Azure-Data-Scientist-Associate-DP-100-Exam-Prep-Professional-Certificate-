Azure Machine Learning supports a range of compute targets, which you can define in your workpace and use to run experiments; paying for the resources only when using them.\n\nYou can create a compute cluster in [Azure Machine Learning studio](https://ml.azure.com), or by using the Azure Machine Learning SDK. The following code cell checks your workspace for the existance of a compute cluster with a specified name, and if it doesn't exist, creates it.\n\n> **Important**: Change *your-compute-cluster* to a suitable name for your compute cluster in the code below before running it - you can specify the name of an existing cluster if you have one. Cluster names must be globally unique names between 2 to 16 characters in length. Valid characters are letters, digits, and the - character."

        "Why is this useful?\nSimplifies Experimentation:\nYou can keep track of every model you train, including its configuration, data, and results. This makes it easier to compare models and choose the best one.\nEnsures Reproducibility:\nBy defining environments and registering models, you make sure that your experiments can be easily repeated and shared with others, ensuring consistency.\nScales Easily:\nIf you need more computational power, Azure ML allows you to scale up by creating compute clusters. This is especially useful for large datasets or complex models.\nCentralized Management:\nEverything (data, models, experiments) is managed centrally in Azure, so you don’t have to worry about storing or losing files on your local machine.\nModel Deployment:\nOnce your model is trained and registered, Azure ML allows you to deploy it for real-world use. This means you can integrate it into applications, websites, or services.\nHow can this be useful in real-world projects?\nData Scientists: Azure ML can help data scientists streamline their workflows, manage large datasets, and automate model training and deployment.\nMachine Learning Teams: Teams can collaborate by sharing environments, datasets, and models, making it easier to work together on large projects.\nBusinesses: Companies can use Azure ML to develop and deploy predictive models for business intelligence, customer insights, or product recommendations, without worrying about managing hardware.\nIn summary, this notebook walks you through using Azure ML to handle all aspects of machine learning experiments, from preparing data to scaling experiments and saving trained models—all with the help of cloud resources!"
