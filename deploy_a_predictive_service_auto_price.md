Exercise Part 7: Deploy a Predictive Service
After you've created and tested an inference pipeline for real-time inferencing, you can publish it as a service for client applications to use. 

Note 

In this exercise, you'll deploy the web service to a Microsoft Azure Container Instance (ACI). This type of compute is created dynamically, and is useful for development and testing. For production, you should create anâ€¯inference cluster, which provide an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster that provides better scalability and security. 

Deploy a service 
1. View theâ€¯Predict Auto Priceâ€¯inference pipeline you created in the previous unit. 

2. At the top right, selectâ€¯Deploy, and deploy a new real-time endpoint, using the following settings: 

Name: predict-auto-price 

Description: Auto price regression. 

Compute type: Azure Container Instance 

3. Wait for the web service to be deployed - this can take several minutes. The deployment status is shown at the top left of the designer interface. 

Test the service 
Now you can test your deployed service from a client application - in this case, you'll use the code in the cell below to simulate a client application. 

1. On theâ€¯Endpointsâ€¯page, open theâ€¯predict-auto-priceâ€¯real-time endpoint. 

2. When theâ€¯predict-auto-priceâ€¯endpoint opens, view theâ€¯Consumeâ€¯tab and note the following information there. You need this to connect to your deployed service from a client application. 

The REST endpoint for your service 

The Primary Key for your service 

3. Observe that you can use the â§‰ link next to these values to copy them to the clipboard. 

4. With theâ€¯Consumeâ€¯page for theâ€¯predict-auto-priceâ€¯service page open in your browser, open a new browser tab and open a second instance ofâ€¯
Azure Machine Learning studio
. Then in the new tab, view theâ€¯Notebooksâ€¯page (underâ€¯Author). 

5. In theâ€¯Notebooksâ€¯page, underâ€¯My files, use theâ€¯ðŸ—‹â€¯button to create a new file with the following settings: 

File location: Users/your user name 

File name: Test-Autos 

File type: Notebook 

Overwrite if already exists: Selected 

6. When the new notebook has been created, ensure that the compute instance you created previously is selected in theâ€¯Computeâ€¯box, and that it has a status ofâ€¯Running. 

7. Use theâ€¯â‰ªâ€¯button to collapse the file explorer pane and give you more room to focus on theâ€¯Test-Autos.ipynbâ€¯notebook tab. 

Important note
You will need to copy and paste the entire block of text presented in the code block.  Make sure you have selected all of the text or data in the code block including endpoints, brackets etc. before copying this over and placing it into the specified position, such as a note pad or program, in the exercise. This will help to avoid errors occurring or having to go back and start the exercise again.  
Example /public function processAPI() {    if (method_exists($this, $this->endpoint)) {        return $this->_response($this->{$this->endpoint}($this->args));    }    return $this->_response("No Endpoint: $this->endpoint", 404);/ 

You can also use the following shortcuts to copy and paste the code: 
1. Click inside the code box and select CTL + A followed by CTL+ C 
2. Alternatively, if you are using a Mac select Command + A and
Command + C to copy all the code to your clipboard8. 


8. In the rectangular cell that has been created in the notebook, paste the following code:

```
endpoint = 'YOUR_ENDPOINT' #Replace with your endpoint
key = 'YOUR_KEY' #Replace with your key

import urllib.request
import json
import os

# Prepare the input data
data = {
    "Inputs": {
        "WebServiceInput0":
        [
            {
                    'symboling': 3,
                    'normalized-losses': None,
                    'make': "alfa-romero",
                    'fuel-type': "gas",
                    'aspiration': "std",
                    'num-of-doors': "two",
                    'body-style': "convertible",
                    'drive-wheels': "rwd",
                    'engine-location': "front",
                    'wheel-base': 88.6,
                    'length': 168.8,
                    'width': 64.1,
                    'height': 48.8,
                    'curb-weight': 2548,
                    'engine-type': "dohc",
                    'num-of-cylinders': "four",
                    'engine-size': 130,
                    'fuel-system': "mpfi",
                    'bore': 3.47,
                    'stroke': 2.68,
                    'compression-ratio': 9,
                    'horsepower': 111,
                    'peak-rpm': 5000,
                    'city-mpg': 21,
                    'highway-mpg': 27,
            },
        ],
    },
    "GlobalParameters":  {
    }
}
body = str.encode(json.dumps(data))
headers = {'Content-Type':'application/json', 'Authorization':('Bearer '+ key)}
req = urllib.request.Request(endpoint, body, headers)

try:
    response = urllib.request.urlopen(req)
    result = response.read()
    json_result = json.loads(result)
    y = json_result["Results"]["WebServiceOutput0"][0]["predicted_price"]
    print('Predicted price: {:.2f}'.format(y))

except urllib.error.HTTPError as error:
    print("The request failed with status code: " + str(error.code))

    # Print the headers to help debug the error
    print(error.info())
    print(json.loads(error.read().decode("utf8", 'ignore')))
```


Note
Don't worry too much about the details of the code. It just submits details of a car and uses the predict-auto-price service you created to get a predicted price.

9. Switch to the browser tab containing the Consume page for the predict-auto-price service, and copy the REST endpoint for your service. The switch back to the tab containing the notebook and paste the key into the code, replacing YOUR_ENDPOINT.

10. Switch to the browser tab containing the Consume page for the predict-auto-price service, and copy the Primary Key for your service. The switch back to the tab containing the notebook and paste the key into the code, replacing YOUR_KEY.

11. Save the notebook. Then use the â–· button next to the cell to run the code.

12. Verify that predicted price is returned.
